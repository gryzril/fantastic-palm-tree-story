So begins the story of Sileebus the magical wood elf. He spent his days toiling at the University of Magicland - Acacia forest
learning the crafts of magic, though he often ran into trouble. Sleebus did not know that the Acacia forest department of magic
required his wand be utilizing wandva 11 and that he would require a remote spell to access the school's magic pool. 

One day, while he was toiling in the forest, he met an old man who was lying inside a hole of one tree, bleeding. The old men 
told him he was fighting against a spider monster at the corner of the forest. People only knew that Acacia forest had the 
famous Magicland University, but few of them knew it is also a dangerous monster colony, where thousands of various types of 
monsters living here. Magicland University is also a protector of human realm against dangerous monsters.

This man seemed to be gravely ill, so Sleebus decided he should go get reagents for a healing elixer for the old man. Sleebus
told the man this and left swiftly, leaving him food and water until he returned. In his head Sleebus kept going over the list
of ingredients he would need -berries, hearty roots, and some magic water. He got the berries and roots close by but kept
searching for the water he needed. As he moved further into the forest, he turned back and wondered how the old man was doing.
When suddenly Sleebus heard the man scream for help.

Immediately turning back to help the man, Sleebus forgot where in the forest he was. He calmly reached for the map in his pocket that laid out the whole forest. He tried his best to remember where the man was, and relied on his instincts to guide him back. On his way back to the injured man, Sleebus had a strange feeling that he was being followed; He slowly turned around and hovering over him was that same spider that fought the old man.
